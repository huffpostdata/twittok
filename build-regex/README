To build regular expressions:

```sh
bundle install
./generate-c++.rb
```

After you've built the C++ one, consider building another for JavaScript. That's
an ordeal, because ES5 and lower don't support Unicode. (A JavaScript regex for
`/[ðŸ’©]/` is equivalent to `/[\ud83d\udca9]/`; apply it to `"ðŸ’©"` and it won't
match, because JavaScript sees `"ðŸ’©"` as two characters but the regex only
matches a single character.)

```sh
npm install
./generate-js.rb
```
